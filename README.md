# Blackjack
This project is a simplified simulation of the card game blackjack.
The game contains a dealer and some players. 
The object of the game is to get a score of 21 or
less using the French deck of 4 suits and ranks 2-10, Jack, Queen, King and Ace.
A card is scored by its rank. The face card JQk are worth 10, and A can be 11(high) or 1(low) depending on the player's choice.
If the score of a player's card is greater than 21 then the player is bust and loses his bet.
So the goal is to get as close to 21 without going over.
The game proceeds as follow:
The palyers makes a wager that is less than or equal to their stake- the money that start with(balance)
The dealer deals 2 cards to each player face-up(visible to all). 
The dealer also reveives 2 cards but only one card is visible to all.<br />
